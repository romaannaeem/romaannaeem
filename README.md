# Hey! 👋 I'm Romaan

I'm a full-stack software engineer with 7+ years of experience building real-world, production-grade web applications, both solo and as a lead. I specialize in React, Next.js, Firebase, and MongoDB, and have recently been working on AI-powered recommendation systems and prompt-driven UX tools.

### 🛠️ Notable Projects:
- **[Best Beer](https://bestbeer.com)** - AI-based beer discovery app with nationwide brewery data, recommendation engine, rewards, and user-driven features  
- **Beer Awards Platform** - Multi-repo Firebase + React platform used by major worldwide competitions (private repo, Bitbucket-based)  
- **Canadian Brewing Awards** - Judging and logistics apps built from scratch under tight deadlines to power national-scale events

> ⚠️ Note: Some of my recent work is private or hosted on Bitbucket. Ask me about my recent projects, happy to walk through code or demos!

💡 I'm passionate about solving real problems with tech, especially where fast development meets user insight. Outside of work, I’m a history nerd, strategy gamer, and coffee-powered builder ☕️.
