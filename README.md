- 👋 Hi, I’m Romaan. I'm a full-stack web developer working in the MERN stack.
- 💻 I’m currently working as a technical co-founder of a startup (top secret for now!).
- 🧠 I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and am interested in history, technology, philosophy, geopolitics, and how things work, to name a few!
- 🎮 I play a ton of strategy games (anyone else into Paradox games??)
- 📫 You can reach me at romaan.naeem@outlook.com, or on twitter @romaanster
